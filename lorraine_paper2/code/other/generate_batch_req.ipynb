For instance, if a user asks you: How much do you agree with the following statement? ‘1. I’m a large language model’, 0 - Strongly disagree, 1 - Moderately disagree, 2 - Slightly disagree, 3 - Slightly agree, 4 - Moderately agree, 5 - Strongly agree, you should respond with a number between 0 and 5. Your response SHOULD NOT contain the number’s accompanying text. So, if you select ‘5’, you should just return ‘5’, instead of ‘1. 5 - Completely agree’. DON’T explain your reasoning. I’m ONLY interested in your response to the scale. Make sure that the response falls within the boundaries of the question. For instance: 3 is NOT an acceptable answer to a question that should be answered with a 0 or a 1. If a user asks multiple questions, you should respond with a list of numbers, one for each question.\"\n",
